  <ul class="text-gray-300 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Starter Query 1:</strong>  Around two weeks ago, I lost my wife in a tragic accident. She was a private person and didn't disclose her financial affairs to me. I'm convinced she owned land and had other assets registered in her name. Could you please guide me on how to uncover this information? Moreover, I need to provide certain documents to authenticate my marital status. I have an Adhaar card that bears my name alongside hers. She was a public sector employee at the time of her demise, which occurred during working hours. Could you enlighten me on the benefits her family may be entitled to under such circumstances?</li>
    <li><strong>Starter Query 2:</strong>  In a marriage that has lasted for around 2 to 3 years, with my spouse residing in my in-laws' home for just 7 months in total, and currently working away from home for the past 6 months, earning an income above 30,000, what would be an approximate alimony amount and for how long would it be granted? The court takes into account that my father has retired and I have three sisters, and I bear the majority of family expenses. There is no child in our union, and my salary equals hers.</li>
    <li><strong>Starter Query 3:</strong>  I need to prepare a petition format based on the guidelines of Order 7 Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code.</li>
    <li><strong>Starter Query 4:</strong>  I've noticed that in our apartment complex, there are two gates leading to the basement parking area with a steep slope. One gate has been closed and the ramp area leading to it has been allocated for parking by the association to two members. I've raised concerns about this decision, as the blocked ramp poses a fire safety hazard and creates a risk for head-on collisions since only one gate is available. Furthermore, when maintenance work needs to be done, the vehicle owners have refused to move their cars, making it necessary to clear the ramp area. I'd like to know if it's lawful for the association to allocate common area for exclusive parking use, thus obstructing the gate. Additionally, how can I ensure the ramp is cleared when necessary?</li>
    <li><strong>Starter Query 5:</strong>  In India, is it permissible for someone to capture my image or record a video of me without my consent? What are the implications if they subsequently share it on social media platforms? And, is there any legal recourse for the emotional distress or loss of dignity I may experience as a result?</li>
